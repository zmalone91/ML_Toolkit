# ML_Toolkit
Analysis and Education tool for different ML algorithms and parameter tuning

* Interactive Web App using Streamlit to play around with some of the common algorithm types in Machine Learning. Including Linear Regression Polynomial Regression, SVR, Decision Tree/Random Forest Regression and penalty/regularization options with L1 - LassoCV, L2 - RidgeCV, and ElasticNetCV. <br>
* The model is both practical and educational as it allows you to see the impact of tuning paremeters to your RMSE and R2 scores.
* Using PCA, the 2 main component features are graphed for a visual represnetation of the data transformed into just 2 dimensions.
